* Anyone with a github account can register a .butts domain name.

* Registration, and subsequent modification, of the domain is done via pull request

* Second-level domains are available on a first-come, first-served basis

* Only the person (well, github account) who originally registered a domain can modify it.

* There's currently not really a procedure for "transfering" a domain - if and when it
  comes up, it should be discussed in a github issue.

* .butts registrations are perpetual, until the original person who registered the name
  submits a pull request to delete the file
  
* we follow the 924 Gilman rules:
